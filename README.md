# Kivy Calendar App

## Project Description

I developed a small app using Kivy that features an interactive calendar, which automatically updates each month and saves user data. Additionally, the app includes a temporary notepad for note-taking. To enable data persistence across app refreshes, I utilized GUI elements along with JSON for saving and retrieving data.

## How to Use

1. Open your preferred code editor and navigate down using `cd Kivy Calendar App/kivy_application` to enter directory
2. Activate the virtual environment by running: `kivy_venv/scripts/activate` (If not working, use: `Unblock-File -Path ".\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1"`)
3. Install the required libraries by running: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Launch the application by executing: `py main.py`
5. Type into boxes, and press save button when done. Shaded boxes means days that already passed.

## Updates

I am still in the process of putting this on any app store or as a chrome extension.
